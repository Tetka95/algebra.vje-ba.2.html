            In a world where so much is being done for technology and so little for the environment, education is not even a part of most of discussions.
            <br>
            <br>
            We at Studytonight believe that by widening the reach of education, by making it freely available, so much can be achieved.
            <br>
            <br>
            And this yourney started in 2013 when a young boy thought "wouldn't it be great to have a website, with simple tutorials for programming languages, just like a friend would teach you!" , and Studytonight waas born.
